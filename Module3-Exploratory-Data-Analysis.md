## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned how to:

* **Describe Exploratory Data Analysis**: By summarizing the main characteristics of the data and extracting valuable insights.
* **Compute basic descriptive statistics**: Calculate the mean, median, and mode using python and use it as a basis in understanding the distribution of the data.
* **Create data groups**: How and why you put continuous data in groups and how to visualize them.
* **Define correlation as the linear association between two numerical variables**: Use Pearson correlation as a measure of the correlation between two continuous variables
* **Define the association between two categorical variables**: Understand how to find the association of two variables using the Chi-square test for association and how to interpret them.
